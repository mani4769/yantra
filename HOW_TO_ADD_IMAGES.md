# How to Add Real Product Images - Quick Guide for Presentation

## URGENT: Add these images before your presentation

### Step 1: Download Free Honey Images
Go to https://unsplash.com or https://pexels.com and search:
- "honey jar"
- "organic honey"
- "honey bottle"

Download 4-5 high-quality honey product images.

### Step 2: Add Images to Project

1. Copy your downloaded images to:
   `C:\Users\manimaddy\yantra_project\yantra\app\src\main\res\drawable\`

2. Rename them (use lowercase, no spaces):
   - `banner_honey_1.jpg`
   - `banner_honey_2.jpg`
   - `banner_honey_3.jpg`
   - `product_honey_gel.jpg`
   - `product_honey_shampoo.jpg`
   - `product_honey_cider.jpg`
   - `product_manuka_honey.jpg`

### Step 3: Update Code (I'll do this for you now)

The code will automatically use these images once they're in the drawable folder.

### Alternative: Use Placeholder URLs
If you can't download images, I can show you how to load images from the internet using Glide library.

**For fastest results:** Just copy ANY 7 honey product images into the `drawable` folder and the app will display them beautifully!
